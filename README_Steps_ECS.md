Hi! Welcome Here's the step by step guide how to create node.js application. Put the node.js app to docker image.Pusher it on amazon ECR. Launch the application using AWS ECS! Goodluck!


Step 1: Terraform automate Infrastructure

✅ Your updated Terraform configuration looks complete and correct! You’ve successfully added:
Component           Description
VPC + Subnets       One VPC with 2 public subnets across AZs
Security Groups     ALB (port 80) + ECS (port 3000, from ALB)
ALB             Public-facing Application Load Balancer
Target Group            Listens on port 3000 (IP mode for Fargate)
ECS Cluster         Fargate cluster with 1–3 tasks (auto scaling)
Task Definition     Uses Docker image myapp:latest from ECR
ECS Service         Deploys the container with Auto Scaling
Auto Scaling            Scales task count from 1 to 3 based on CPU ≥ 70%

Step 2: Creating node.js App. Create Docker Image for this Node.js app and Push the Docker image on ECR 


Step 3: Set up full CI/CD
Using:
✅ GitHub (code + workflow)


✅ Docker + ECR (container image)


✅ ECS Fargate (deployment target)


✅ Terraform (infra already provisioned)
